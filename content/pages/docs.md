Summary: The SpaceAPI format documentation.

It's highly recommended to use the explicit specified fields from the
reference. If you need other fields additionally, please make a change request.
Or prefix custom fields with `ext_` to make it clear the field is not part of
the documented API. Consumers are not obligated to interpret any custom fields.
