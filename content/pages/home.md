Title: Space Directory
Status: hidden
save_as: index.html

The Space Directory project is a friendly fork of the
[Space API](http://spaceapi.net/) project that was started during
[33c3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Communication_Congress).

The purpose of the Space API is to define a unified specification across the
hackerspaces that can be used to expose information to web apps or any other
application.

## The Fork

The reason for the fork was that the original project at spaceapi.net wasn't
being maintained anymore. Pull requests were waiting for multiple months or
years and sometimes the API was down.

This fork aims to revive the development activity around the Space API. But
we're always ready to merge our efforts into the original project!

## Status

- [x] Add API documentation
- [x] Port JSON schema files to new format (IETF draft 4)
- [ ] Write a simple schema validator (work in progress)
- [ ] Rewrite the directory server (planning)
